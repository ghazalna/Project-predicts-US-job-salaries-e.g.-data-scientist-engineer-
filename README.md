# Salary-Estimating
Salary Prediction with Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting average salaries for job titles like Data Scientist and ML Engineer. The Jupyter notebook includes:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Removal of missing values and irrelevant columns.

2. Features:
   - State, Job Title, and Company Rating are key features for salary prediction.

3. Linear Regression:
   - Training the model to establish relationships between features and average salary.

4. Testing:
   - Evaluating the model's accuracy in predicting salaries.

5. Deployment:
   - The trained model is dumped for future use, enabling seamless integration into other applications.

Explore the notebook for insights into machine learning-driven salary predictions. Contributions to enhance the model are welcome!
