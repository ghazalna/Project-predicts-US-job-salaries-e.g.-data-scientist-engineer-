# Salary Estimating - Predictive Modeling

Welcome to the Salary Estimating repository! This project is centered around predicting average salaries for various job titles, including data scientist, data engineer, deep learning engineer, machine learning engineer, director, manager, analyst, and researcher in the USA. The prediction is based on a variety of factors, including company size, industry, location, company name, and job title.

## Project Overview

In this repository, we implement predictive modeling techniques, specifically Linear Regression and classification regression (Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest), to estimate average salaries for different roles in the tech industry.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** A thorough cleaning process focusing on relevant features such as company rating, state, job title, and more.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of Linear Regression and classification regression algorithms for accurate salary estimation.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Understanding the impact of various factors on salary predictions.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Visual representations of salary predictions and insights for better understanding.

## Contents

1. **Data Cleaning:** Code and documentation for the cleaning process, ensuring data quality for accurate predictions.
2. **Modeling:** Implementation of Linear Regression and classification regression models using popular algorithms.
3. **Evaluation:** Metrics and analysis of model performance.
4. **Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs providing insights into salary predictions.
5. **Recommendations:** Actionable recommendations based on the findings.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different models, and contribute to enhancing the accuracy of salary predictions. Your contributions are valuable in refining our understanding of salary trends in the tech industry.

Happy Modeling!
